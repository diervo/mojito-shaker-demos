What is Shaker?
###############


Shaker is a static asset rollup manager for Mojito applications.
A rollup consists of one or more input files that are combined (rolled up) to produce a single output file. Rollups can be as simple as a single file, a single mojit binder and its dependencies, or any combination thereof. Shaker allows you to create rollups regarding different combinations of dimensions. For example, you may want to serve different assets when people access your web site or web application using different devices, from different countries, etc.


Why Shaker?
###########


Mojito does not have the ability to serve complex rollups. Shaker improves Mojitoâ€™s rollup abilities in many ways.

**Example:** This is how you dynamically add your assets in Mojito, based on some dimension (in this case, the device):

::

	// controller logic
	var device = ac.context.device,
        css = '/static/device/assets/simple';

	if (device === 'iphone') {
		css += '.' + device;
	}

	css += '.css';

	ac.assets.addCss(css, 'top');

**Example:** this is how you dynamically add your assets with **Shaker:**

::

	// No logic to write!
	// Rollups are picked up automatically :)

When dealing with multiple dimensions, the logic that you have to write can quickly become complicated. With Shaker, we do all of this automatically for you. You just put your assets in the right folders and Shaker will take care of adding them if needed.
